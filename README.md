# Experiment-3

# 1. Student Grade Calculator<br>
# Aim:<br>
To calculate the average marks of a student in three subjects and determine their grade based on predefined criteria.<br>

# Tools used:
Programiz online compiler

# Theory:<br>
Grading systems help evaluate academic performance. By calculating the average of marks obtained in Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, and applying conditional logic (if-else statements), the program assigns a grade:<br>
A: 90 and above<br>
B: 80–89<br>
C: 70–79<br>
D: 60–69<br>
F: Below 60<br>

# Algorithm:<br>
Start the program.<br>
Take input for marks in Maths, Physics, and Chemistry.<br>
Calculate the average of the three subjects.<br>
Use if-else conditions to assign grades:<br>

If average ≥ 90, grade = A<br>
Else if average ≥ 80, grade = B<br>
Else if average ≥ 70, grade = C<br>
Else if average ≥ 60, grade = D<br>
Else, grade = F<br>

Display the grade.<br>
End the program.<br>

# 2. Check if Number is Positive or Negative<br>
# Aim:<br>
To determine whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.<br>

# Theory:<br>
A number’s sign tells us a lot. If it's greater than 0, it's positive. If it's less than 0, it's negative. If it's 0, it's neutral. This is done using simple comparison conditions.<br>

# Algorithm:<br>
Start the program.<br>
Declare an integer variable num.<br>
Take input from the user.<br>
Use if-else:<br>
If num > 0 → print "Positive"<br>
Else if num < 0 → print "Negative"<br>
Else → print "Zero"<br>
End the program.<br>

# 3. Find Quadrant of a Coordinate<br>
# Aim:<br>
To determine which quadrant a given point (x, y) lies in.<br>

# Theory:<br>
The coordinate plane is divided into 4 quadrants:<br>
Quadrant I: x > 0 and y > 0<br>
Quadrant II: x < 0 and y > 0<br>
Quadrant III: x < 0 and y < 0<br>
Quadrant IV: x > 0 and y < 0<br>
Points on the axis or origin are treated separately.<br>

# Algorithm:<br>
Start the program.<br>
Declare two integer variables: x and y.<br>
Input values of x and y.<br>
Use conditional statements:<br>
If x > 0 and y > 0 → Quadrant<br> I
Else if x < 0 and y > 0 → Quadrant II<br>
Else if x < 0 and y < 0 → Quadrant III<br>
Else if x > 0 and y < 0 → Quadrant IV<br>
Else if x == 0 and y == 0 → Origin<br>
Else if x == 0 → Lies on Y-axis<br>
Else → Lies on X-axis<br>
Display result.<br>
End the program.<br>

# Conclusion: 
These programs apply C++ conditionals to solve real-world problems like grade calculation, number sign check, and coordinate quadrant detection, strengthening logical thinking and decision-making skills.
